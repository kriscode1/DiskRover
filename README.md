# DiskRover
Scans a storage drive and builds an interactive map of files by file size.

Visually see which folders and files are taking up the most space in your filesystem. I've tested it on Windows 8.1 but would like to hear about other operating systems as well. Must have Java installed to run.

Inspired by SpaceMonger v1.4.0 by Sean Werkema. I'm so glad you wrote it.
