# DiskRover
Scans a storage drive and builds an interactive map of files by file size.

Visually see which folders and files are taking up the most space in your filesystem. Tested on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, but I would like to hear about other operating systems as well.

If you cannot open jar files (because Java is not installed), download Java here first: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

Inspired by SpaceMonger v1.4.0 by Sean Werkema.
